# Website Builder

See it live [here](https://jordan-checkoff.github.io/Website-Builder/).

## Description
Bootstrap is a helpful tool for reducing the repetitiveness of website-building. However, Bootstrap components are bulky and hard to read â€“ they are divs within divs within divs. Also, there is still a lot of repetitiveness that Bootstrap does not reduce, like menus that each must be updated one-by-one when a new page is added. 

To solve this problem, I developed this website builder using React. It is an easy-to-use website template that contains many helpful components for speeding up website-building. With this website builder, the majority of a website can be built just using the included React components and HTML; only some additional CSS is required to finish the design. Each components has several parameters for modifying its design, so very little custom CSS is required. Also, some components automatically adjust based off of the number of children they have.

## Installation
To begin using this website builder, first create a react app using `$ create new-react app [app-name]`. Then download the code from this repository and move it into the folder of your react app to replace the default files.

## How to Use
### Step 1: Create pages
For each webpage you would like on your site (other than the home page):
- Duplicate "Home.js"
- Rename the file to give it a unique name

### Step 2: Set variables in UserData.js
- Open "src/UserData.js"
- For each new page you created, import it below the import for "Home". Import it using `import [page name] from ./sections/[page name]`
- Change the `name` variable to your website's name
- If you want to use a logo in your website, set the `logo` variable to the link to your logo; otherwise, set it to an empty string
- Set the `pages` variable to a list of the pages on your website. Each item in the list should be `{name: "[page name]", link: "[path]", component: [imported page component]`}
- If you would like banners for your website (see [Banner](#banner)) set the `banner` variable to a list of links to the images. This step can be returned to later

### Step 3: Edit Header
- Open `src/sections/Header.js`
- Add all the components you want within `<HeadFootMaker>` (see [HeadFootMaker](#headfootmaker))

Notes:
- Children will automatically line up in a row, so to form a column of components, just wrap those components in a `<div>` tag.
- There are several components that make it easier to make headers (see [Logo](#logo) and [Menu](#menu))

### Step 4: Edit Footer
- Open `src/sections/Header.js`
- Add all the components you want within `<HeadFootMaker>` (see [HeadFootMaker](#headfootmaker))

Notes:
- Children will automatically line up in a row, so to form a column of components, just wrap those components in a `<div>` tag.

### Step 5: Edit Pages
For each page:
- Open the respective file
- Add all the components you want within the top-most `<div>`

Notes:
- The page should be grouped into `<Strip>` components (see [Strip](#strip))
- There are several components that make it easier to make pages (see [Banner](#banner) and [ColLayout](#collayout))

### Step 6: Edit Styles
- Open `src/styles/_vars.scss`
- Edit any of the variables to set the styles for your webpage
